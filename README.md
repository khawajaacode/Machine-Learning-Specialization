# 📘 Machine Learning Specialization Assignments

Welcome to the **Machine Learning Specialization Assignments Repository** by [khawajaacode](https://github.com/khawajaacode). This repository features clear and well-structured solutions for the Coursera **Machine Learning Specialization** by **Andrew Ng**, offered in collaboration with DeepLearning.AI and Stanford University.

The coursework is divided into three main tracks:

1. **Supervised Machine Learning**  
2. **Advanced Learning Algorithms**  
3. **Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, and Reinforcement Learning**

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔧 Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
- Python libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `tensorflow`

Install all dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

💡 *Tip: Use a virtual environment to avoid package conflicts.*

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### ▶️ Running the Notebooks

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/khawajaacode-machine-learning-specialization.git
cd khawajaacode-machine-learning-specialization
```

2. Launch Jupyter:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

3. Open the desired `.ipynb` file from the relevant course folder.
